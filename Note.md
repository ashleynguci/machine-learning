Empirical risk: 
Used to measure an approximation of the error of the model, 
called the empirical risk, by computing the average of the losses on individual instances


TrainingData: 
{(xi,yi)}m/i=1,(x,y)∈Rd ×R

1 − δ 
sets a level of confidence, 
if we are content of the training algorithm to fail 5% of the time

ε 
sets the level of generalization error that is of interest to us, 
say we are content with predicting incorrectly 10% of the new data points: ε = 0.1
